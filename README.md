In this project I will conduct a data analysis of customer records at Electronic Store using microsoft excel as an analysis tool. I will practice to find insights and summaries of sales performance, and identify what is best and can be improved for the store. This can help to create promotions and strategies based on the sales performance for each store.

ABC Company is a company engaged in the sale of electronic goods such as refrigerators, irons, blenders, and others. ABC Company has offline stores in various countries and cities.

The sales system at ABC company is that there is a discount on every offline purchase depending on the strategy of each branch. Sales recording of ABC Electronic Store for the analysis is from 2020-2024.
